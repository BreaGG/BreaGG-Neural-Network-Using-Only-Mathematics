# BreaGG-Neural-Network-Using-Only-Mathematics
neural network built from scratch using only basic mathematical operations and Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. Trained and evaluated on the MNIST dataset, this implementation avoids high-level deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or Keras.
